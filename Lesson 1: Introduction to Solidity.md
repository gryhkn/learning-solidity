# Lesson 1: Introduction to Solidity

Welcome to the first lesson on Solidity! In this lesson, we'll cover the following topics:

**What is Solidity?**

**How does Solidity work?**

**Setting up your development environment**

## What is Solidity?

Solidity is a programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist on the blockchain network.

## How does Solidity work?

Solidity code is compiled to bytecode, which can be deployed to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and run on the blockchain. The EVM is a decentralized runtime environment that executes the code of smart contracts.

## Setting up your development environment

To start writing Solidity code, you'll need to set up a development environment on your computer. Here's what you'll need:

- A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for writing code. Some popular options include Visual Studio Code and Remix.
- The Solidity compiler, which translates your Solidity code into bytecode that can be deployed to the Ethereum blockchain.
- A way to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. One option is to use the command line tool truffle.
- Once you have these tools installed, you're ready to start writing Solidity code!
